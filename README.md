 NOTE: At this time, the reverse-engineered PCB design is only useful for relative component location -- the design is non-functional and cannot be fabricated as-is. However, the process to convert a photograph of the traces into a copper layer was tested during this re-engineering project. Further work needs to be done to process the photograph to eliminate shadow and reflective anomolies before a practical test can be conducted. That's on the to-do list.

A thank you to [Mystic Effects Co](https://mysticeffectsco.com) for a helpful and inspiring FL9 capacitor replacement blog post. Also to Panasonic for continuing to maintain on-line datasheets for the bucket brigade delay and clock driver chip set. Let's not forget how great it is that DigiKey still stocks fresh through-hole capacitors in their produce aisle.
