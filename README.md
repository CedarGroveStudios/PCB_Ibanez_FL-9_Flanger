 NOTE: At this time, the reverse-engineered PCB design is only useful for relative component location. The reverse-engineered PCB design is non-functional and cannot be fabricated as-is. The process to convert a photograph of the traces into a copper layer was tested during this re-engineering project. Further work needs to be done to process the photograph to eliminate shadow and reflective anomolies before a practical test is conducted. That's on the to-do list.
