 NOTE: The reverse-engineered PCB design was only used for relative component location -- the design is not functional and cannot be fabricated as-is because it has no copper layer.

A thank you to [Mystic Effects Co](https://mysticeffectsco.com) for a helpful and inspiring FL9 capacitor replacement blog post. Also to Panasonic for continuing to maintain on-line datasheets for the bucket-brigade delay and clock driver chip set. Let's not forget how great it is that DigiKey still stocks fresh through-hole capacitors in their produce aisle.
